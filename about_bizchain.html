        <h1>About BizChain</h1>

        <p>
            BizChain is a business verification and transparency platform developed to address the
            increasing challenges faced by consumers when dealing with online and digital businesses.
            As e-commerce and social media marketing continue to grow rapidly, users are frequently
            exposed to businesses whose legitimacy and credibility are difficult to verify.
        </p>

        <p>
            BizChain serves as an independent platform that enables users to assess business credibility
            by providing access to verified registration information, combined with structured community
            feedback. By doing so, the platform helps users make informed decisions before engaging in
            financial transactions or long-term business relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>Why BizChain Exists</h2>
        <p>
            Many fraudulent activities occur because users assume that a business appearing professional
            online is legitimate. Scammers often exploit this trust by using copied branding, fake
            registration numbers, and untraceable contact details to deceive consumers.
        </p>

        <p>
            BizChain was created to reduce these risks by introducing accountability and verification
            into the digital business ecosystem. The platform provides a structured approach to
            identifying legitimate businesses while highlighting potential warning signs based on
            verified user reports.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to promote a safer and more transparent digital marketplace where consumers
            can interact with businesses confidently. BizChain aims to minimise financial losses caused
            by scams while encouraging ethical practices among business owners.
        </p>

        <p>
            By establishing a trusted verification framework, BizChain supports responsible business
            growth and enhances public confidence in online commerce.
        </p>

        <h2>How BizChain Works</h2>
        <p>
            BizChain requires businesses to submit official registration documents and owner identity
            information during the registration process. These details are reviewed to confirm that
            the business is legally registered and accountable under applicable regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once verified, businesses are granted a visible verification badge, which signals credibility
            to users browsing the platform. At the same time, BizChain continuously monitors user feedback
            and reports to identify unusual or suspicious activity.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Businesses are verified using official registration and ownership information to ensure
                legitimacy and traceability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Verified businesses are clearly labelled to help users distinguish them from unverified
                or suspicious entities.
            </li>
            <li>
                User reviews and reports contribute to an ongoing assessment of business behaviour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scam warnings are displayed only after multiple verified reports and internal review.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Community Reporting & Reviews</h2>
        <p>
            Community participation is an essential component of BizChain’s verification ecosystem.
            Users are encouraged to share honest experiences and submit reports based on actual
            interactions with businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
            To prevent misuse, reports are handled confidentially and may be reviewed before any warning
            indicators are displayed. This ensures that businesses are treated fairly while still
            protecting users from potential harm.
        </p>

        <h2>Transparency & Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
            Transparency is a core principle of BizChain. The platform does not make unverified accusations
            or definitive judgements without sufficient evidence. Instead, BizChain presents information
            in a balanced manner that allows users to evaluate risks independently.
        </p>

        <p>
            Businesses are encouraged to respond responsibly to feedback, while users are expected to
            report honestly and ethically. This shared responsibility helps maintain the integrity and
            credibility of the platform.
        </p>
